_I did this project like starting of the pandemic(a year ago to be precise), by that time i just started learning python. I just this project folder backup this month and I thought to post it here. I didn't want to change anything so it's basically noob coding, you may find unused lines in the code I have removed almost everything I could find. Variable and function names are sometimes random( even I can't understand :/). I have only edited the url and response codes nothing else :). **Enjoy!**_


# What is this repo about?
A telegram bot which checks accounts. This is totaly based exploiting unsecure site to check different email and password combination, it may be random or dumped combos. This repo doesn't encourage any illegal or criminal activities, any misuse mahy result in very bad outcome and you will have to deal it yourself
# Does it give free premium accounts?
No, it doesn't give any **free** accounts. If you provide a email and password, the bot will try to login to that account and check if it works. If works it will check 
if any premium plans are subscribed by the user. And reply to you in telegram and with plan details.

# It means WE can check unlimited times
Yes, but NO. I don't use any proxy servers as you can see in the code. Some sites have security like you can't login after 3-5 unsuccessful attempts. Or may even change their security making it bit stronger and hard. So its better not to do so.

# Available sites are
Altbalaji, Hoichoi, Voot and Zee 5. Could easily expand but don't have that much time. Anybody want to contribute can check the Bot folder and Checkers folder or view any other checkers file and make a checker for new site and sent pull request, I will be glad to accept it.
